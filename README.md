Balthazar's Final Exam was the product of a 48 hour game jam (5th April to the 7th April 2024), with the</br>
goal to raise money for the charity [Mind](https://www.mind.org.uk/), hosted by [Climax Studios](https://www.climaxstudios.com/). 

The idea being that a clumsy wizard (named Balthazar) has been unable to pass his exam of wizardry,</br>
and has one last chance to succeed.</br>

The jam's theme was 'periodic', which was integrated into the game by having the spells that Balthazar</br>
casts change after a short time interval. In theory, these spells could be extremely powerful, to downright</br>
annoying to the player. Within the game there are 4 spells: </br>

   (1) <b>Arcane Weapon</b> (user presses left-mouse to swing an etherial axe),</br>
   (2) <b>Fire Wall</b> (user moves the mouse to change the facing-direction of a huge wall of fire),</br>
   (3) <b>Eldritch Blast</b> (user moves the mouse to change the facing-direction of an insta-kill beam).</br>
   (4) <b>Invisibility</b> (all enemies turn invisible).</br>
   
Made in the Unity game engine. </br>
Submitted to the Climax Game Jam (2024). </br>
